# MINI SHELL

A basic shell which can do the following-
1. find files
2. change directory
3. help command to show available commands or information about a command

The program summond.c in /bin/source summons a daemon process and terminates so that the shell may continue to print the next prompt. This is unlike other programs where the shell waits for it to finish before printing the next prompt.
